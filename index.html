                The idea for this project is to analyze how different Reddit communities ("Subreddits") have grown between the years 2015 and 2025. The goal is to see what topics have grown in popularity as well as the overall emotional opinions on them from Reddit users themselves. We aim to identify trends in topic popularity, the correlation between sentiment and virality as well as what communities experience the most positive or negative reactions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our visualizations will only focus on the top 10 most popular Reddit communities for brevity. Specific analysis might be done on communities with the highest or lowest sentiment score as well. Additionally, we would like to acknowledge that we plan on focusing on topics that are non-explicit and that are appropriate for the class due to the nature of the platform.

                    This is a bubble plot where the Y-axis represents the average engagement on the subreddits, calculated as the sum of scores and comments. The X-axis shows the average sentiment on the subreddits, ranging from negative to positive, based on the sentiment score. Since the visualization is double-encoded, the size of the bubbles represents engagement, and the colour represents sentiment.                    </p>

                        AskReddit shows the highest engagement by far, followed by pics, while the other subreddits have similar engagement levels. Positive sentiment is observed in the subreddits for funny, gaming, and sports, and negative sentiment in news and technology. Overall, we see that high-engagement subreddits tend to have neutral sentiment, whereas smaller subreddits show stronger positive or negative sentiment.

                    <h2>Reflecting on this visualization?</h2>

                    <p>A lot of the graphs show a trend where their sentiment seems to have plummeted as the engagement rises, hinting to a general rise in negativity on social media as thing get popular. However there are also some that show signs of stability or increase in positive sentiment like like r/gaming, r/memes and r/todayilearned.</p>
                    <p>What could be causing this negative sentiment? while its difficult to point to a direct cause, it can be a multitude of factors, maybe with changing socio-political climates, negative and hateful speech is getting more attention ? or a different perspective could be that this is a consequence of the attention economy that social media creates. This would mean that people are spewing hate simply to get more traction online. With Reddit’s “hate purge” in 2020 they seem to have taken some attention to the matter. </p>

                    Overall, this project was really fun to work on and we learned a lot about data visualization and sentiment analysis along the way. There were definitely some challenges with the dataset and the tools we used, but we were able to overcome them and create some interesting visualizations. We hope that our work can contribute to a better understanding of online communities and their emotional dynamics.
