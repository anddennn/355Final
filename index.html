                The idea for this project is to analyze how different Reddit communities (“Subreddits”) have grown between the years 2015 and 2025. The goal is to see what topics have grown in popularity as well as the overall emotional opinions on them from Reddit users themselves. We aim to identify trends in topic popularity, the correlation between sentiment and virality as well as what communities experience the most positive or negative reactions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our visualizations will only focus on the top 10 most popular Reddit communities for brevity. Specific analysis might be done on communities with the highest or lowest sentiment score as well. Additionally, we would like to acknowledge that we plan on focusing on topics that are non-explicit and that are appropriate for the class due to the nature of the platform.

                Overall, this project was really fun to work on and we learned a lot about data visualization and sentiment analysis along the way. There were definitely some challenges with the dataset and the tools we used, but we were able to overcome them and create some interesting visualizations. We hope that our work can contribute to a better understanding of online communities and their emotional dynamics.
