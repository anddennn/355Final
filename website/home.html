    <h1>Understanding social media trends</h1>
    <Section class="issue">
        <h2>The Issue:</h2>
        <p>The idea for this project is to analyze how different Reddit communities (“Subreddits”) have grown between the years 2015 and 2025. The goal is to see what topics have grown in popularity as well as the overall emotional opinions on them from Reddit users themselves. We aim to identify trends in topic popularity, the correlation between sentiment and virality as well as what communities experience the most positive or negative reactions. 
            Our visualizations will only focus on the top 10 most popular Reddit communities for brevity. Specific analysis might be done on communities with the highest or lowest sentiment score as well. Additionally, we would like to acknowledge that we plan on focusing on topics that are non-explicit and that are appropriate for the class due to the nature of the platform.

The goal is to see what topics have grown in popularity as well as the overall emotional opinions on them from Reddit users themselves. We aim to identify trends in topic popularity, the correlation between sentiment and vitality as well as what communities experience the most positive or negative reactions. </p>

        <h2>Our Tasks:</h2>
        <h3>Track emotional trends: </h3>
        <p>Through the course of this project, we aim to collect data from Reddit that helps us understand the emotional trends in people's reactions when they reply to a post. Are these responses coming from a positive place, like empathy and care? Or are negative emotions like frustration and hostility guiding their responses? By examining these emotional patterns, we hope to gain insight about the broader tone of online discourse and how people's emotions shape engagement.</p>

        <h3>Compare subreddits and popular topics: </h3>
        <p>We want to understand what kind of subreddits are gaining the most traction online, whether they focus on news, entertainment, lifestyle, technology, niche interests or others and then try to analyse if there is a recurring theme of pattern in these. By doing this, we can understand what subjects or online communities are resonating most with people. </p>

        <h3>Identify reaction patterns: </h3>
        <p>We also aim to understand how different users react to posts across these subreddits and what the overall sentiment of their responses is. Are they trying to be supportive in helpful ways? Sharing their opinion? Or are they responding with humour or sarcasm? Thus, we can understand the overall sentiment of these Reddit communities by identifying reaction patterns.</p>
