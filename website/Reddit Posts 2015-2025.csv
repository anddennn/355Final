The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for [8 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKo_rpVid0) — the time George Floyd was held down by police — and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world. **This will take place at 8PM CDT.** AskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it’s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion. This is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it’s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too. With all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society. We ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you’re able.

A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \_\_\_\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a ""shower thought"" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward. We do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions. For example: * “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion. * “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question. Our philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review. Thank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.

Played the beta of Star Wars battlefront 2 and you still can't just get in a vehicle, it feels so fake. Why is Rey in the clone wars!? That is all bad, but EA have just totally taken the piss with abusing Star Wars fans and cutting their games into little pieces and bleeding the fan base dry. I've had enough. #boycottswbf2 #boycottea Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check. Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues. All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change. Edit 3: Thank you kind strangers for the reddit gold!

It's shady. It is, according to the internet, worth hundreds of thousands of downvotes. And now, on top of everything, if you want to remedy the situation you are forced to sit in an exaggerated phone line. But keep in mind, the people taking your call at EA are having a much worse day than you! These people are not the CEO, they're not the game designers, and they may not even be located in the same building as these people. They are just trying to do their job, and it just so happens that they work at a company currently undergoing a pseudo scandal. So be kind to them. Because at the end of the day, they probably hate EA right now too. Edit 1: Thank you, kind Redditor, for the Gold! And thank you to the community for supporting the idea of showing kindness to others! Edit 2: Thank you to the other four Gold-givers as well! We almost hit #1 on the front page, but I think we topped out at #2. I'm happy to see that a positive post was able to reach so high in the midst of this event! Edit 3: I'd like to extend (likely) one last thank you to the Redditor who awarded this post its sixth gold, and to the community that actually took this post to #1 on the main page.

"8swmb2","https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/8swmb2/youtuber_potates_completely_plagiarized_a_post_i/","gaming","Youtuber ""Potates"" completely plagiarized a post I made on r/Fallout about Fallout 76, and passed it off as his own work. The video is now at 800k views.","EDIT 5: Just wanted to thank everybody for their interest in this topic and in me as a content creator. Now that things are cooling off, I will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out. There are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a YouTube channel and I just wanted to acknowledge that. I really appreciate your interest and may set something up, but I don't have anything at this moment to share. Thanks everybody for their kind words and support. :) I'm not sure why this thread was locked, I didn't get a message from the mods about it. I assume just because the thread has run its course, and I'm okay with that. **EDIT 2:** I had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- I only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. I am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and I want to make it abundantly clear that I do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against Potates. Be better than that. Thanks. Potates has DM'd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. He has been cool about the whole situation and I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. Neither he nor I knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. Again, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at Potates. Do not harass him, do not harass his family. These actions are 100% wrong and I condemn them wholeheartedly. Calling him out for his behavior is one thing, but when you cross the line into his real life, you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass. **EDIT 4:** I am aware that Potates has removed all his videos except for his apology. I am not responsible for this, and I have not filed any kind of DMCA claim against him as we are settling things privately. I have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his YouTube channel, as I believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy. Plagiarism is serious, and there is a lesson here to be learned -- if he respects the content of *all* creators moving forward, then his channel can become a positive part of YouTube again. It is easy to be angry at this situation, believe me. But I am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change, and for now, I am willing to give that chance and let things play out. ------------------- Link to the Potates video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26s5aMSBWY Link to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qsx8s/complete_notes_from_the_noclip_documentary/ \^That's a massive Fallout 76 info dump based on the Noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. It took me a while to write up as I watched the documentary, and I spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. Shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said ""served as blueprints"" which is a nonsensical statement. I'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though I'm not a professional. So to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. When you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck. He starts his video off at the ""Gameplay"" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. As the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. I'm not *too* upset because I'm glad more people got to see the information, but I am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. He reads the post like it was his script! Even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words I wrote from a page. I only found this video at all because I clicked it and wanted to hear new Fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, I realized that I had heard those words before... because I wrote them! Here's the thing. If he had shot me a message saying ""hey man, I'd like to quote this post in a video"", I'd have said go for it 100%. If at the beginning of the video he had said something like ""hey guys I found this post on reddit I'd like to read you"", I'd be fine with that. But the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. I feel like I put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his. EDIT: I see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. Unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in. --------------- **EDIT 3:*** ~~I tried to comment on Potates' apology video, but the comments aren't going through. Here is what I wrote, if I am able to post it directly on the video I will do so in the morning.~~ **EDIT 5:** It appears as if the apology video has been deleted. > Hey, I'm _Robbie. First off, I would like to lead with the fact that I completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to @Potates and his family. Nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this. > Secondly, I would encourage @Potates not to delete his YouTube channel. I do not agree that there is no coming back from this. Mistakes were made, feathers were ruffled, and lessons were learned. I have seen smaller YouTube channels come back from worse. I have given Potates full permission to re-post the offending video under the agreement that I am properly credited, and that we can work out our differences in private. I truly believe in the value of giving somebody another chance, and even in spite of everything, I am willing to give Potates another chance. > This whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted. Me and Potates are making things right between us in private as I type this and I am confident that we will come to an understanding.","127332","4662","2018-06-21","0.0","neutral"

The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control. The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content. **If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.** The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech) [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud. Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again. Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.","114344","2468","2017-05-23","-0.7184","negative"

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits! Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby. This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content. The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** **EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** **EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity.

The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. **But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act.** The groups behind the big Net Neutrality [day of action](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) that happened back on July 12 are calling on all Internet users, websites, apps, subreddits, and online communities to do everything they can to drive as many phone calls to Congress as possible between now and November 22. **There's an easy click-to-call tool set up at https://www.battleforthenet.com** **We have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join** Our best shot at saving net neutrality is if we can get phones ringing off the hook in Washington, DC right NOW.

"6e8wta","https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/","technology","Eight members of Congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill Net Neutrality as well","FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. We can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai’s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. Here’s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing. They’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan. Here are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai’s attack on net neutrality: * Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730) * Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) (Twitter: [@MarshaBlackburn](https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn); phone: 202-225-2811) * Sen. John Thune (R-SD) (Twitter: [@johnthune](https://twitter.com/johnthune); phone: 202-224-2321) * Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) (Twitter: [@RogerWicker](https://twitter.com/rogerwicker); phone: 202-224-6253) * Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) (Twitter: [@SpeakerRyan](https://twitter.com/speakerryan); phone: 202-225-3031) * Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) (Twitter: [@CathyMcMorris](https://twitter.com/cathymcmorris); phone: 202-225-2006) * Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA) (Twitter: [@RepTomGraves](https://twitter.com/reptomgraves); phone: 202-225-5211) * Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH) (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405) All of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.) **Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** We can’t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai’s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai’s plan. It’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet. EDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of Pai’s plan at the FCC, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too. * Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) (Twitter: [@SenMikeLee](https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee); phone:202-224-5444) * Sen.

Congress just snuck it into the must-pass omnibus package.","Congress just attached the CLOUD Act to the 2,232 page, must-pass [omnibus package](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180319/BILLS-115SAHR1625-RCP115-66.pdf). It's on page 2,201. The so-called CLOUD Act would hand police departments in the U.S. and other countries new powers to directly collect data from tech companies instead of requiring them to first get a warrant. It would even let foreign governments wiretap inside the U.S. without having to comply with U.S. Wiretap Act restrictions. Major tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oath are [supporting](https://blogs.microsoft.com/datalaw/wp-content/uploads/sites/149/2018/02/Tech-Companies-Letter-of-Support-for-Senate-CLOUD-Act-020618.pdf) the bill because it makes their lives easier by relinquishing their responsibility to protect their users’ data from cops. And they’ve been throwing their lobby power behind getting the CLOUD Act attached to the omnibus government spending bill. Read more about the CLOUD Act from EFF [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/new-backdoor-around-fourth-amendment-cloud-act) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), and the ACLU [here](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/cloud-act-dangerous-piece-legislation) and [here](https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-letter-cloud-act). There's certainly MANY other bad things in this omnibus package. But don't lose sight of this one.

These Senators are trying to damage privacy & security while everyone is distracted with Coronavirus! EFF made this easy tool so you can tell your senators.","[**Link to EFF's easy tool to tell your senators.**](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill) While the media and people are distracted with COVID-19, two Senators have been sneaking through an attack on privacy and online security. Imagine an Internet where the law required every message sent to be read by government-approved scanning software. Companies that handle such messages wouldn’t be allowed to securely encrypt them, or they’d lose legal protections that allow them to operate. [Take Action](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill) That’s what the Senate Judiciary Committee has proposed and hopes to pass into law. The [so-called EARN IT bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text), sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), will [strip Section 230 protections](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/graham-blumenthal-bill-attack-online-speech-and-security) away from any website that doesn’t follow a list of “best practices,” meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy. The “best practices” list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban encryption, and guarantee law enforcement “legal access” to any digital message. This is the next FOSTA - which was disaster for many users and small companies. The EARN IT bill had its first hearing March 12th, and its supporters’ strategy is clear. Because they didn’t put the word “encryption” in the bill, they’re going to insist it doesn’t affect encryption. “This bill says nothing about encryption,” co-sponsor Sen. Blumenthal said at today’s hearing. “Have you found a word in this bill about encryption?” he asked one witness. It’s true that the bill’s authors avoided using that word. But they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption. It would create a 19-person commission that’s completely controlled by the Attorney General and law enforcement agencies. And, at the hearing, a Vice-President at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) made it clear \[[PDF](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Shehan%20Testimony.pdf)\] what he wants the best practices to be. NCMEC believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that NCMEC considers abusive; use screening technology approved by NCMEC and law enforcement; report what they find in the messages to NCMEC; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others. You can’t have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can [create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/there-no-middle-ground-encryption). The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like “client-side scanning” aren’t a clever route around this; such scanning is [just another way to break end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption). Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it’s available to others. The 19-person draft commission isn’t any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. It’s completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like NCMEC. Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of best practices. Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr’s veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them. The Commission won’t be a body that seriously considers policy; it will be a vehicle for creating a law enforcement wish list. Barr has made clear, [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/doj-and-fbi-show-no-signs-correcting-past-untruths-their-new-attacks-encryption) and [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/fancy-new-terms-same-old-backdoors-encryption-debate-2019) again, that breaking encryption is at the top of that wish list. Once it’s broken, authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those governments want to suppress. The privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law enforcement is able to achieve its dream of breaking encryption. Senators should reject the EARN IT bill. \- Deeplinks Blog | by Joe Mullin | March 12, 2020 &#x200B; **e: List of Co-Sponsers of the disastrous 'EARN IT' act** thank you u/Popular-Uprising- Sen.

Also they will both make alot of Money ( i hope so ) So my hope is, this starts a trend. EDIT: since a lot of people are telling me ""just watch it in 2D then, no one is forcing you"" I live in germany and the theatre that I go to ( which i own a membercard to ) has all the showings in 3D until 2-3 weeks after the movie came out. maybe it will have a 2D showing once per day, but that will be like at noon on a monday or something.

"ha4t7t","https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ha4t7t/adam_sandler_said_he_would_make_a_terrible_film/","movies","Adam Sandler said he would make a terrible film if he didn't win a Best Actor Academy Award for Uncut Gems. To help him out, I analyzed his films and their movie posters to come up with a perfectly bad Sandler film entitled 'Jacked Up'","Earlier in the year, Adam Sandler was a guest on Howard Stern’s show to discuss his starring role in the excellent *Uncut Gems*. During the interview, Sandler made a joke about what would happen if he didn’t win the Best Actor Academy Award. [He told Howard](https://www.businessinsider.com/adam-sandler-threatened-to-make-bad-movie-if-he-doesnt-win-oscar-uncut-gems-2019-12): “If I don’t get it, I’m going to f–king come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay. That’s how I get them.” In a bad news, bad news situation, Sandler wasn’t nominated, and he’s promised to make a terrible film (I’ll still watch it a few times regardless). In an effort to assist the Sandman with his terrible film, I dug through all of his films and analyzed their posters to come up with the objectively worst Sandler picture that could be made. Here it is: * *Jacked Up* * Directed by Dennis Dugan * Written By - Tim Herlihy * PG-13 * Running Time: 135 minutes * Released on Netflix * Predicted Tomatometer score - 6% * Predicted IMDb score - 3.75 Adam Sandler plays a personal trainer/shoe salesman named Jack Goodheart who is married to Janet Goodheart (Also, Sandler, using a very off-putting voice). They travel to an exclusive resort in Costa Rica to attend his 30th high school anniversary during the fourth of July weekend. During the event, Rob Schneider (playing a terrorist) and his team of henchmen, hijack the event and take everyone hostage, including State Senator Chuck Finley (Terry Crews) and presidential candidate Casey Fitzpatrick (Maya Rudolph). During the melee, Jack and Janet escape, and the two use their past military experience and buff physiques to save the day. This PG-13 action-comedy is entitled “*Jacked Up*” and ends with a jet ski chase at the hotel’s lazy river pool that circles the hotel. The film is directed by Dennis Dugan, and co-stars Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Terry Crews, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Lautner, Luke Wilson, Peter Dinklage, Maya Rudolph, and Al Pacino. [Here's the first fan made poster](https://i.imgur.com/s6NDxCM.jpg). I'll add as more people share. Thank you /u/Kelkith [Here is another fan made poster!](https://imgur.com/u3gRDyQ) Thank you /u/TreMetal [Another very fun poster!](https://imgur.com/a/k1X5rUq) This is how I came up with the storyline. I pulled together his best and worst films to find patterns that appear. Here are Sandler's lowest rated films on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. I drew a lot of inspiration from them. Also, I tried to make this as objective as possible. * *The Ridiculous 6 (0% TM)* \- Action Comedy - Action hero * *Jack and Jill (3% - 3.3 IMDb)* \- Two Sandler's - Jet Ski scene - Married - Holiday * *Grown Ups 2* (7%) - Reunited with old friends - Married * *Bulletproof* (8%) - Action comedy * *The Cobbler* (9%) - Shoe repairman * *The Do-Over (10%)* \- Action Comedy - Reunited with old friend - Married * *Grown Ups (10%)* \- Reunited with old friends - Holiday - Married * *Adam Sandler’s Eight Crazy Nights (12%)*\- Takes place during a holiday * *Blended* (14%) - He’s a dad who travels to Africa * *Going Overboard* (1.8 IMDb) - Lots of terrible boat action * *The Week Of* (5.1 IMDb) families get together for a wedding * *Sandy Wexler (5.1 IMDb)* \- Sandler pulls a unique voice (which isn’t statistically a good thing **Here’s all I research I compiled to create** ***Jacked Up*** * A trademark of Sandler’s latest movies is that he likes to travel to beautiful locations to film (which is brilliant, and why not?). *The Do-Over, Just Go With It, Blended*, *Grown Ups 1 & 2* and *Murder Mystery* are examples of his penchant for travel. The problem is, the films have a lower Tomatometer average (21.2%) than the films where he didn’t travel to nice locations (37.4%). This is why he travels in *Jacked Up*. * Sandler has several directors that he enjoys working with. Those Directors are Steven Brill, Dennis Dugan and Frank Coraci. Steven Brill (20%) has a lower Tomatometer average than Dennis Dugan (24%) and Frank Coraci (30%). However, Dugan is responsible for *Jack & Jill*, so I’m giving him the director’s chair. He did direct *Happy Gilmore*, so this could backfire on me. Frank Coraci directed *The Ridiculous 6*, but, [I love the baseball scene ](https://youtu.be/sI6LvdaozEk)and he also directed *The Waterboy* and *The Wedding Singer.* * Aside from *You Don’t Mess With the Zohan* ([which is brilliant, and has a fun jet ski action scene](https://youtu.be/5OfAMHeIr7k)), His action comedies are lackluster. *Bulletproof* (8%) and *The Do-Over (9%)* didn’t win him many points. That’s why *Jacked Up* features an action-centered plot. * His films featuring him as a married man have a 29% Tomatometer average. Movies featuring him as a single man have a 38% Average. Thus, the marriage to himself (think *Jack & Jill*) is included. It’s a double whammy * I picked Tim Herlihy to write because he wrote *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups 2* and *Pixels (8% average)*. I do love his *Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer* and *The Waterboy* scripts though * His PG-13 (29%) rated films have a lower Tomatometer average than his R (51%) and PG-rated (45%) films. For Netflix, M rating = R and TV-14 = PG-13 * I included a pool because in [*Airheads* he is a pool cleaner who thinks about swimming pools](https://youtu.be/YryTJKsn2i0). Also, *Grown Ups, The Do-Over, Jack and Jill* feature swimming pools. They have low scores. * Movies that feature Sandler doing a voice have a lower Tomatometer score (24.8%) than his regular voiced roles (36%). * None of his Fresh films feature a jet ski -[ *50 first Dates*](https://youtu.be/S__SZwFn0Rw) *(45%),* [*Jack & Jill*](https://youtu.be/leAGt-vpIf0) *(3%)* and *You Don’t Mess with the Zohan (37%)* are all Rotten * In *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups, The Do-Over*, and *Bulletproof* he plays a totally capable man who isn’t an underdog like he is in *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore*. So, he can’t be a doofus during the action scenes. * Randomly enough, Rob Schneider shouldn’t adopt some kind of stereotyped character because his makeup-less roles have a lower Tomatometer average (27.6%) than his stereotyped roles (32%). * His lowest rated movies on IMDb are *Going Overboard* (1.5), *Jack & Jill* (3.3), *The Ridiculous 6* (4.8), *Sandy Wexler* (5.1) and *The Week Of* (5.1) - These movies feature water exploits, gun fights, weird voices, two Sandlers, and large gatherings. These things are all in *Jacked Up*. * \*Bulletproof (\*$25 million), *Little Nicky* ($39 million) and *Blended* ($46 million) are a few of his lowest grossing comedies. In these films, he uses a wild voice, goes on vacations and engages in action shenanigans. I left out movies like *Spanglish* and *Reign Over Me* because they aren’t traditional Sandler comedies. Also, *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore* weren’t huge earners. However, they established him as a force of nature. * His first or last name couldn’t begin with an “R” - Howard Ratner (*Uncut Gems*), Henry Roth (*50 First Dates*), Robbie Hart (*The Wedding Singer*). **WHAT DOES THE POSTER NEED TO LOOK LIKE?** * He cannot be centered on the poster. His best films *Punch Drunk Love, Happy Gilmore, Funny People* and *Uncut Gems* feature him centered on the poster. *The Wedding Singer, Reign Over Me* and *The Meyerowitz Stories* don’t have him centered. However, the movie posters that have centered have a 48% Tomatometer Average. The Posters that have him on the left have a 30% Tomatometer average. I’m going with that. https://preview.redd.it/actfhq081a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c8031c0894460b3d33ee218f96d31e80abcd3df He' rarely centered in his ""worst"" films https://preview.redd.it/7592qqi41a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff647a066806a5dfbf516fd83ebff761d79621dc * There needs to be multiple people on the poster. When Sandler is alone on a poster, his movies have a 42% Tomatometer average. The movie posters with 4+ people have a 20% Tomatometer average. More is good. * In this poster he needs to be holding something random. In *The Cobbler* poster he is holding a coffee cup (this is important) and the movie has an 8% Tomatometer score. In *The Wedding Singer* (microphone) and *Happy Gilmore* (golf club) and *The Waterboy* (bucket, helmet) he is holding items related to his character. He needs to be holding something weird (like a can of sponsored coca-cola). Also, the posters that feature him holding an item (31%) have a lower Tomatometer score than the posters featuring him not holding anything (42%). &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/l6mzirud1a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8ccf8ee14641d421c38e2c0775f00299e517d83 * It’s best if his entire body is on the poster. The movie posters featuring a full-bodied Adam Sandler have a lower Tomatometer average (31%) than his partial body posters (43%). * Ideally, the title would be in the center, because *Jack & Jill* and *The Ridiculous Six* have somewhat centered titles. **Poster** * Title centered * Sandler(s) on left side - Full body * At least six other characters on the poster There you have it! I can't wait to watch *Jacked Up*. **If you like this random post, make sure to check out my other random data on Reddit.** [Movies featuring snowmobile action scenes are way cooler than movies
